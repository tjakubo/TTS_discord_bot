# TTS_discord_bot
WIP

# Installation
1. Clone the repo  
2. Run ``sh install.sh`` to install dependencies  
(or install Luvit and Discordia on your own)
3. Create a new app (a bot) on https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me/
4. Copy its token and save it as a text in a ``token.dat`` file in the project dir
5. (optional) Create a ``elevated_users.txt`` file with your Discord name#tag for admin commands to work
6. Add/invite your bot to your testing server (you need permissions on it, create your own if you need to)
7. Run ``./luvit bot.lua``
8. Type ``!ping`` to see if it's alive
